            <p>In order to understand Ruby you first need to understand a few simple concepts, however it may be tricky to wrap your head around some of them. If you don't quite fully understand it, try re-reading it and then continue and as we employ these concepts you may begin to better understand them. These are concepts found in many programming languages and whilst other programming languages may implement them slightly differently, understanding them in Ruby will make it easier to learn other programming languages.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are a core concept in programming. Often you will find a need to temporarily store a value such as a position which you can then use later and variables are a method of doing that. Values in Ruby can be stored into variables which can be dynamically changed even relative to themselves so you can add to a value. So say you wanted to count to ten you could store your current number in a variable and add one to that variable after each number.</p>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body examplecode">
                    <p>x = 5</p>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-footer">
                    <p>This creates a variable x and assigns a value of 5 to it.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>Functions define behaviour that can be carried out either to manipulate variables, or have a side-effect such as moving a robot forwards. Functions allow you to carry out actions multiple times without having to program them multiple times as you can call them as many times as you want. The efficient use of functions will make your code easier to understand so it is a good idea to get accustomed to their use.</p>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body examplecode">
                    <p>moveForward</p>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-footer">
                    <p>Calls a function called moveForward</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
            <p>Objects are similar to what you would call an object in the real world, they contain variables and methods (another name for functions). Objects are created from classes which define what makes up the object and then an object is created from its setting variables to define the specific object. A good metaphor is a chair. When you say chair you know roughly what that means however you don't need to know the material or shape, just the abstract concept and what you can do with it. This is a good description of a class, it defines what you can do with objects of the type and says what variables they will contain such as material but does not need to define them. An object then is an implementation of a chair so a specific chair with defined material and shape.</p>
