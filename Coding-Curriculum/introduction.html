            <h3>What is Ruby?</h3>
            <p>Ruby is a popular programming language with many applications, one of its most common applications is for creating powerful websites using a framework (a base upon which developers build) called Ruby on Rails, however it can be used for pretty much anything. We chose Ruby for this guide as we believe it is a good introduction to programming making it easy for you to explore different programming paradigms within a single language, and having a straightforward and easy syntax.</p>

            <h3>About this guide</h3>
            <p>This guide is divided into chapters which you can see on the homepage. Each chapter consists of a number of lessons covering specific topics. Programming is a skill best learnt by practice so our lessons contain challenges for you to complete yourself, we have tried to use real world examples as far as possible so you can see practical uses of programming.</p>

            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>We are a group of students from UCL studying Computer Science and we aim to provide you with a better understanding of computer science and programming. Here is a short introduction to each of us:</p>

                <p>Hi, I  am a first year computer science undergraduate and I only started coding recently. I became interested in coding because of my interest in maths, analysis and problem solving. This project has helped me to begin programming in ruby. By creating some of the lessons for the project, I have been able to further my understanding of this language and also developed my communication and creative thinking skills.</p>
                <h4>Alex</h4>
                <img></img>
                <p>Greetings, I study Computer Science at UCL, my name is Alex and I enjoy programming. I have experimented with programming for years although my study has become more concentrated in the University environment.</p>
                <h4>Nathan</h4>
                <img></img>
                <p>Hey, Iâ€™m am currently doing a bachelors of science in computer science. I have been programming for roughly a year with a strong background in mathematics and computational biology. I enjoy app development and cryptanalysis in my free time.</p>
                <h4>Kalingen</h4>
                <img></img>
                <p>I am currently in my first year of studying computer science. I entered the undergraduate course due to an interest in maths and the realisation that I enjoyed programming as well through a general studies course in school.</p>

            <h3>What you will need</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A browser</li>
            <p>We have set up this guide so that you can program most of the code on the web pages in the code boxes.<p>
			<br/>
				<li>Ruby Compiler</li>
			<p>If you want to go further beyond this guide, you can download Ruby from <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">here</a> and you can use it to complete the questions in the extra detail section as well as the projects. You will also need a text editor such as Notepad++ to write your Ruby code. The Ruby file should be saved as .rb file e.g. file_name<strong>.rb</strong>. Then open up terminal and change the directory to where the file is. In order to compile and run the code, state the file name on terminal e.g. file_name.rb and the output of your code will be displayed on terminal.</p>
